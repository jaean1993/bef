#“Beauty and the Beast”

In the film, Belle is a first year intimidated by Yale and its students. The narrative follows her as she navigates the school, finds her identity as a Yalie and lights a romantic spark with the Beast of Harkness Tower. Really amazing!

> It’s not just about the orchestra, It’s about you and me, our residential colleges and the Yale spirit. We want attendees to think, ‘Wow, that was on the Facebook meme page last week.’ <cite>- Producer Margo Williams</cite>

去年万圣节半夜在security的车上和崟峰说等找到工作了今年就来看Halloween show，虽然当时觉得自己要去ICC。
现场乐队和电影感染力真的强，一把年纪最后也开始跟着喊go bulldogs，离毕业还有一个多学期，终于开始有些觉得自己是yale的学生了
