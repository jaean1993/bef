Given a clock with three button, first one can advance one hour, second one can advance one minute, third one can reset time to 00:00.
Design an api to print the button order of adjust initial time to given time.

```
public List<String> timeAdjust(String initialTime, String targetTime) {
	#List<String> result1: use reset button
	#List<String> result2: do not use reset button
	#return shorter one
}
```
